## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running the built app locally

* Navigate to the **dist** folder
* Edit **index.html**
* Change the line  `<base href="/">` to  `<base href="./">` (tell the app to use relative URL insted of the default absolute ones)
* Open index.html in browser and voila!
